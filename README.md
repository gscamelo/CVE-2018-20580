# CVE-2018-20580
A proof of concept for ReadyAPI 2.5.0/2.6.0 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.

## Intro
In December 2018 I found a new vulnerability in the ([ReadyAPI|SoapUI](https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/)). It allows an attacker to execute a remote code on the local machine putting in danger the ReadyAPI users, including developers, pentesters, etc...

The ReadyAPI allows users to open a SOAP/REST project and import WSDL files that help the users to communicate with the remote server easily.

In WSDL file, the file owner can determine the default values of some parameters. An attacker can impersonate a legitimate web service and inject a malicious Java code into a default value of one of the parameters, and spread it to ReadyAPI clients.

When a ReadyAPI client load a malicious WSDL file to his project in the ReadyAPI and send a request containing the malicious code, the ReadyAPI will execute the malicious Java code on the victim's computer.

## POC

The attack scenario:
+ An attacker impersonates a regular web service with a malicious WSDL containing the malicious code.
+ The victim creates a new project in the ReadyAPI and loads the malicious [WSDL](https://github.com/gscamelo/CVE-2018-20580/blob/master/example.wsdl)
+ The victim decides to send a request to the remote server, the ReadyAPI executes the malicious code.
+ The attacker succeeds in executing malicious code in the victim's machine and will take it over.
